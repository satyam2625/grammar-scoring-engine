Grammar Scoring Engine – SHL AI Internship Task

This project implements a Grammar Scoring Engine for voice samples, developed as part of SHL's AI Research Internship assignment. The solution extracts acoustic features from audio files and trains a machine learning model to predict grammar scores.

It also provides a baseline Kaggle Notebook for direct competition submission.

✅ Features

Audio Preprocessing: Silence trimming, normalization

Feature Extraction: MFCC, zero-crossing rate, energy, speaking rate

Model: Random Forest Regressor (baseline)

Optional ASR: Wav2Vec2-based text features (future upgrade)

Submission: Generates submission.csv for Kaggle
